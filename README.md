# Rock_vs_mine_predictor
This project uses machine learning to classify objects as either rock or mine. The model uses sonar frequency data and demonstrates ML full workflow from data loading to evaluation
## Problem Statement
Correctly identifying underwater objects is critical in naval and marine operations.  
This project aims to predict whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine using supervised learning.
## Results
The trained model achieves good accuracy in distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sonar data.
